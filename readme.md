# Integer Sequence Generators in JavaScript

Some of [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integer_sequences) in JS.

Generate them running (and customizing) `list.js` in this repo:

```
node list
```

Currently it generates up to 10,000 of each for now, one at a time, and saves them into the `list` folder.
